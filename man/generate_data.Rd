\title{Generate survival data for analysis}
\usage{
generate_data(n = 500, scenario = "A")
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size}

\item{scenario}{Character designating the simulation scenario: 0 = NULL, no association, A = simple, one variable
is linearly associated with IRIS,
B = simple multivariate, 5 variables are linearly associated,
C = wonky, interactions, nonlinearities, etc.}
}
\value{
A data frame with X variables, censored survival times (competing risk w death), and true cumulative incidence at 26.5 weeks
}
\description{
500 subjects, 20 variables, about 20% cumulative incidence. 5 variables truly associated,
some linear, some wonky associations, an interaction, and some variables correlated.
}
