Description: Code to run a simulation study and evaluate the results for a statistical method
    using superlearner run on pseudo-observations to predict the cumulative incidence of a 
    survival outcome with competing risks. The model is then evaluated using the time dependent
    ROC curve which is also estimated using pseudo-observations. The method and results will 
    appear in a forthcoming paper.
